## What can I do for you?

I currently work in a software house which provides Mobile Financial Services to big companies. I started
there fresh out of college 3 years ago and have excelled a lot since then in mobile technologies which is my domain of interest. Be it small Android applications or enterprise Android projects, I’ve the skill set to accomplish a project on my own.
Being an expert ApplicationDeveloper, I am able to give back to the company and community I’m a part of.


## What I know?

* Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler
* Right tool for the job
* Do one thing but do it well
* Write expressive code and quality software
* Working with legacy code, refactor and optimize code

## Where I excel?

In a short period of time I have learnt a lot and kept myself on my toes to compete with my colleagues who are far more experienced than me. In fact, I have successfully increased my skills and my understanding of android world to beat most of my experienced colleagues in short period of time.

> I am quick learner and adaptable which makes me an excellent resource in any kind of environment.

## Achievements in current role

Whenever I thought something is going wrong, I took a step back and tried to solve it in an efficient manner. While working on Apps in Evamp, I have seen a lot of bad code written by novice developers and to be honest we struggled with it too. I have worked on many of these problems and proposed my own solutions to it.

#### Coconut Input Validation library

> Validating input fields require a lot of effort and boilerplate code on developer side. I have tried to solved
> this problem by creating a library which does all this work in a very effective manner. It amazingly reduces
> your validation logic to only a *single line* and makes you productive when dealing with input validations.
> See [this](https://github.com/allaudin/coconut-input-validator){:.blue} link for reference.

#### Networking library

> For networking,  I have fully compiled my own library keeping Evamp’s need in mind. As almost every project in Evamp
> communicates to network, **this library reduces around 20% of developer's burden and allow them to be more productive**.Visit
> [this](https://github.com/allaudin/ease-volley-wrapper){:.blue} link for details.

#### NPE ([The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions))

> NPE is a nightmare for Java Developers and Evamp has suffered a lot from it. I have written an annotation processor to
> prevent app from crashing because of `NULL POINTER EXCEPTIONS`. **According to Fabric, we had around 10% decrease in crashes after integrating this library**.
> See [this](https://allaudin.github.io/yabk/){:.blue} link for reference.

#### Parsing view IDs with ease

> One of the curmbersome tasks in Android is getting view reference in java code. You have to write biolerplate code
> again and again for getting the new IDs from XML. I have solved this issue by creating an annotation processor which
> does view-id binding and update them automatically. It greatly helps in writing code with same structure and use it
> without any extra effor. See [this](https://allaudin.github.io/oxygeroid/){:.blue} link for reference.

All these libraries greatly help developers to focus on something more important (business logic) and save precious time.
